To use an image as a link in an HTML document, you can use the following code:

<a href="URL">
  <img src="IMAGE_FILE" alt="LINK_NAME">
</a>
Replace "URL" with the destination URL that you want the image to link to, "IMAGE_FILE" with the file path or URL of the image, and "LINK_NAME" with a brief description of the link.

For example, if you want to use an image of a shopping cart to link to an online store, you could use the following code:

<a href="https://www.mystore.com">
  <img src="shopping-cart.jpg" alt="Shop Now">
</a>
This will create an image that, when clicked, will take the user to the specified URL.
