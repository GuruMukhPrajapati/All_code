To link to another page by opening a new window, you can use the following code:

<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>

Replace "http://www.example.com" with the URL of the page you want to link to, and "Link" with the text that you want to use as the link. When the user clicks on the link, it will open the page in a new window.
