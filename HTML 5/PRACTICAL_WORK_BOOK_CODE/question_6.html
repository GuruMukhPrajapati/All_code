To create an HTML link in a document, you will need to use the "<a>" element. The "<a>" element stands for "anchor," and it is used to create hyperlinks that allow users to navigate to other pages or websites.

    To create an HTML link, you will need to use the following syntax:
    
    <a href="URL">Link Text</a>
    
    Where "URL" is the address of the page or website you want to link to, and "Link Text" is the text that will be displayed as the link.
    
    For example, if you wanted to create a link to the Google homepage, you could use the following code:
    
    <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
    This would create a link with the text "Google" that, when clicked, takes the user to the Google homepage.
